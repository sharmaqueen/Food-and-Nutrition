<i><u><h2 align="center">Dosa </h2><font size="11"></i></u>
  <P align="justify"> <font face="Bodoni MT" size="10"> Dosa is a fermented crepe made from rice batter and black lentils. It is a staple dish in South Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. It is also popular in other parts of India, and other countries like Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Singapore. Dosa, a common breakfast dish and street food, is rich in carbohydrates, and contains no sugar or saturated fats. As its constituent ingredients are rice and Urad Dal, it is gluten-free and becomes a complete protein. The fermentation process increases the vitamin B and vitamin C content.  There are also instant mix products for making dosa, with somewhat lower nutritional benefits.
