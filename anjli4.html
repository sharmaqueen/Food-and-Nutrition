Many of these dishes are generally mixed and eaten with steamed rice, which is the staple food of the region. Except for Brahmins and a couple of non-Brahmin castes, most Tamilians eat non-vegetarian food. However, on a typical day, a Tamil family will eat mostly vegetarian food, and the intake of meat is lower than in most parts of the world.Tamil cuisine groups dishes under five slightly overlapping categories -Gravy dishes to be mixed in rice , Accompaniments ,Standalone snacks , Dessert , Fast foods or light meals.
